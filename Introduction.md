# AI
Imitate the human activity/ Performing the activity as human 
# Machine Learning
Ability to learn from the data without explicitly programming

1. Supervised (Regression, Binary, Classification)
- Learn from the Labeled data 
2. Unsupervised (Clustering)
- Grouping the data into  similar groups of clusters
3. Reinforcement 
-  Decision Making from Uncertainty 
- Learn from mistake and correct it by the user input

6 Steps involved in Data Science Life cycle:

1. Define the problem
2. Collecting the data
3. Clean the data [Numeric, Text, Classification] /  Exploratory the data 

	-  Univariate analysis (pd.Describe)
		- min
			ii. max
			iii. mode
			iv. Std
			v. Quartile
			vi. Outliers 
			vii. confidence interval
	- Data type identification (pd.info)
	-  Visualize
		○ Univariate
			§ Bar - Categorical - Location, Balcony, Furnished/Unfurnished
			§ Line - More no of Categorical,  continuous 
			§ Histogram/ distplot - Range/ Interval Type (Y - frequency)
		○ Bivariate
			§ Scatter Plot  
				- Correlation between two variables
				- Correlation ranges -1 to 1
				- X variable should be independent 
				- X1, X2 have same effect on the Y variable
				- Identify the impact on x on y
			§ Pair Plot
				- All in one picture
			§ Reg plot
			§ Box Plot
				- Wishcus - MIN 25- 50-75 - Max
				- outliers
				- Distribution
			§ Count Plot
				- SNS
				- Bar Chat
				- Categorical
			§ Probability Density Function
			§ Cumulative Density Function
			
4. Model Building
5. Evaluate 
6. Deploy the Model
